ICVS, who we are

The Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS) was established in 2003 to develop biomedical research within the School of Medicine of the University of Minho.

Currently, the ICVS is a multidisciplinary unit that brings together scientists, engineers and clinicians in a unique scientific and technological environment encased within over 6000 m2, benefiting from research expertise in different fields such as bioimaging, cell and molecular biology, deep learning and computer science, electrophysiology, epidemiology and statistics, structural and functional MRI analysis, medical electronics, microbiology with ABSL2/3 facilities, regenerative medicine, motor and cognitive animal behavior, oncobiology and surgical endoscopy. Our knowledge encompasses the complete R&D pipeline: from in vitro research to animal models, drug discovery and pre-clinical validation, to clinical trials, and finally to reach the market as innovative medical solutions.

Over the last decade, the ICVS has developed synergies with several partners with complementary expertise, namely the 3B’s Research Group ensuing the establishment of the PT Government ICVS/3B’s- Associate Laboratory, local healthcare providers and the Clinical Academic Centre – Braga Association (2CA-Braga), devoted to performing clinical research. The ICVS is also integrated several national research infrastructures, among which PT-OPEN and EATRIS.PT, for drug discovery and development.

The ICVS develops projects in national and international consortia, providing experience and training to young researchers, welcomes foreign students and researchers, and launches initiatives to foster international institutional collaborations, such as those established with the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory (INL), the Centro de Investigacións Biomédicas (CINBIO) and the Radboud University.

Along with its several Spin-offs, the ICVS aims to contribute as a key stakeholder for the upholding of a competitive Cluster in Biomedical Science, Technology and Healthcare, steered by the School of Medicine, including the 2CA-Braga, the Digital Medicine center P5, and the knowledge transfer structure B.ACIS. Aligned with this vision, the ICVS aspires to boost its complete research pipeline to create scientific knowledge and value, producing Research Outputs that improve Clinical Outcomes.

Governance

The ICVS is a subunit of the School of Medicine (EMED), and as such it is governed by the Presidency of the School of Medicine, the Scientific Council of the School of Medicine and the School Council.

The ICVS has its own governing bodies, according to the rules for research units integrated in the National System of Science and Technology. The Direction of the ICVS is the collegial body representative of the ICVS and responsible for its overall management and coordination. It has the following composition:

The Directive Board is composed by the Direction members, the Vice-President for Research of the School of Medicine (António Salgado) and the elected representative among the team leaders (Luísa Pinto).

The ICVS Directive board is supported by two consultive organs: the Scientific Council of the ICVS constituted by all PhD researchers and by the coordinating committee of team leaders.
